## Lead Sheet

Another lead sheet for the collection. I took some extra time developing this one, as this is easily my favorite spiritual. As always, reference material is below. I particularly love any recording by Pete Seeger, as he's recorded quite a few… hundred… folk songs, and his recordings tend to be (1) easy to understand, and (2) easy to pick apart, both of which suit my purposes just fine.

## Transcription

Here's a transcription of Pete Seeger's recording. What's cool is, he taught audiences to sing it live. (He did this kind of thing more than once, apparently). I've been getting into three-part arrangements lately, so I wrote down what I heard on the recording for my own reference and study. Hope y'all enjoy it!
