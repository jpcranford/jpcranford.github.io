Hello again! Sorry I've been out of it for a while, I finally switched my major to Music and I've been having the time of my life. But now that that's started to let up some, here's a little something. One of my favorite scenes from Studio Ghibli's movie Castle in the Sky is near the beginning, when the dawn breaks and Pazu plays this on his trumpet. Hope you all enjoy!
