This is still a work in progress. We performed it my last year of high school, and from that I've got tons of edits on paper to sort through. Also, I've since lost my research and source material folder for this, so I'll be working from scratch.

"Please Don't Sue Me" disclaimer: I only claim the arrangement as my own, and if anyone knows who/how to credit the original I will quickly and gladly do so. I will also take this down immediately if asked, but I hope it doesn't come to that, because as far as I know this is the only available arrangement of the piece, anywhere.
