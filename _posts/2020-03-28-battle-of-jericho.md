title: Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho (Lead Sheet)
categories: Music
---

One of the main sources I used for this lead sheet was a book by Pete Seeger titled American Favorite Ballads, available on the Internet Archive ([link](https://archive.org/details/americanfavorite00seeg/page/37/)). While the book itself is still under copyright, it lists this song among others under the note: "The following songs are to the best of our knowledge, in the public domain, therefore no permission is necessary to reprint the versions given in this book." (p. 5)

So I've taken that version, and made a few changes to reflect the more popular recordings out there, and my own personal taste.
