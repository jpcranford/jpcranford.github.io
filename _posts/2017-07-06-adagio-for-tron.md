I listened to this song back when I was just starting senior year in high school, and immediately suggested it to my orchestra teacher. Fortunately for me, there were no published arrangements of it whatsoever, so that night I cracked my fingers, loaded up the song, and got to work. Two weeks later, I had a draft ready, but in my haste I had forgotten how difficult C# minor is to play (it sure sounds beautiful though!). So, long story short, this went from zero to concert-ready in a few months and was then performed at the Halloween 2014 concert for the school. As always, questions and comments are appreciated!

The original is definitely not in the public domain, so I host it on MuseScore, which has deals with the copyright owners to allow certain music to be played.
