title: When Joseph Went to Bethlehem (Accompaniment)
categories: [Music,Church,Christmas]
---

The ward Christmas program last month found me on the piano for this song, and I ended up embellishing something on the original found the Children's Songbook (link below). I originally made this up off of and read from the original, but I soon realized that having my accompaniment written down *might* be helpful when under the pressure of performance. Enjoy!

Here's the [original](https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/when-joseph-went-to-bethlehem), for reference.
