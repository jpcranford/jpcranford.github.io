title: Black Velvet Band (Lead Sheet)
categories: [Music,Folk]

Happy early Pioneer Day! In preparation for this day, I've been thinking about folk music, which led me to remember a songbook project I started back before I got myself a Pro account. So, in the spirit of this very obscure holiday, I've decided to treat you all to the fruits of that project, one lead sheet at a time. Everything you need will be on the sheet: melody, chords — and most importantly for folk music — more lyrics than you could ever sing in a single sitting! (No, seriously. It's so easy to invent lyrics for these things, they should teach it in elementary schools.)

The first song in this list is an old favorite of mine: The Black Velvet Band. I'm partial to the version by The Dubliners and the live recording by The High Kings (links below), so the lyrics I've included probably reflect those two more than any.
