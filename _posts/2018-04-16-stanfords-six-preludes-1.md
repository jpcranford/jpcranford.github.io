title: Stanford's 6 Short Preludes and Postludes, No. 1 (Transcription)
categories: [Music,Organ]
---

This is a transcription of a [work](http://imslp.org/wiki/6_Short_Preludes_and_Postludes_-_Set_1,_Op.101_%28Stanford,_Charles_Villiers%29#15512) for organ on IMSLP. In order to make it easier to read and more aesthetically pleasing, I've changed the way the manuals have been notated in a few places, switched it to a portrait layout, and changed the way the rests are notated.

This arrangement is based on a work in the public domain, and is available to download for free on MuseScore.com.
