title: Free Accompaniment on DUANE STREET
categories: [Music,Organ,Church]
---

A special organ accompaniment I originally wrote for my brother's mission homecoming in August 2019. The text and tune is in the public domain, the arrangement is my own.

If you use this in any way, I'd love to hear about it! I'd consider it the highest of compliments to know that somewhere, something I made is being played by someone I've never met. Contact info is on my profile page.

Further info:
- The hymnal [page](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/library/hymns/a-poor-wayfaring-man-of-grief?lang=eng&_r=1) the congregation sang from (always a good starting point)
- [Info](https://hymnary.org/text/a_poor_wayfaring_man_of_grief) about the text, "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief"
- [Info](https://hymnary.org/tune/duane_street_coles) about the tune, DUANE STREET

This arrangement is based on a work in the public domain, and is available to download for free on MuseScore.com.
