Went to my brother's wedding this week, and somehow this song ended up being in my head the entire week. Something about the haunting melody and the somber yet well-wishing lyrics seem fitting for both a wedding and funeral, in a way.

Did this one in an older style, breaking the lines by phrases and italicizing the chorus. Found a new button in the MuseScore menus ("Split Measure Before Note/Rest") that helped out a ton. Also, I let the chord symbols play for this score, they don't seem to distract as much here. As usual, references and sources for the song are below. In particular, this song's entry at the Traditional Ballad Index includes references to lots of source books.
