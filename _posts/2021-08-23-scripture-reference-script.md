title: Scripture Reference Parser
categories: [Coding,Church]

This is a fun little script I wrote in AppleScript that parses a given LDS scripture reference — Gen. 3:4 or John 3:16, for example — and opens it in the Gospel Library app, or failing that ChurchOfJesusChrist.org.

It'd be a trivial thing to make this into a Shortcut and/or add it to a right-click menu, but unfortunately my MacBook doesn't support macOS Monterey.
