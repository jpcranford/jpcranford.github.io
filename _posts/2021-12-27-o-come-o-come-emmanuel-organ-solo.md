A basic organ solo on the traditional tune "O Come, O Come Emmanuel." It'd be very simple and easy to play — and that was the intention — but the program date was approaching and the half step modulation sounded too good. Maybe I'll revisit this one day, and change it to Dm — Em or something so it's simple again.

This arrangement is based on a work in the public domain, and is available to download for free on MuseScore.com.
