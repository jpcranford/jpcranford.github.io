Lorem ipsum. Content to be written. Until then, info dump below.

Welcome to my personal blog, where I post stuff I've done. Sometimes tech, sometimes music, and on occasion just for fun.

- Musician
	- **Pipe Organ**
    - **Keyboard.** I've played in a few bands, playing Hammond organ, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, synth, and piano parts. I tend to favor rock and blues, with some jazz.
    - **Composer.** I arrange and occasionally write music for fun. I'll usually post that material to my [MuseScore profile](https://musescore.com/jpcranford/).

- Programmer
	- AppleScript
	- JSON
	- Markdown
	- HTML, CSS, SCSS

### Currently learning
